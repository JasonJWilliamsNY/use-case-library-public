# Use Case Suggestion Form

**Contributed By:** <Name, Team>

## Scientific Objective:

*Describe one or more lines of scientific inquiry without reference to a specific technology solution or type of user. Focus exclusively on the hypothesis, resources required, method(s) followed, and outcome(s) targeted. Ask for each: can the importance and relevance of this be validated with scientific stakeholders?*

## Persona Involved:

*Either the name of the persona that applies to your Use Case, or a description of a new Persona. See current list of personas [here](https://github.com/dcppc/design-guidelines/labels/persona)*

## User Epics:

*Write 1-3 epics  from the user's perspective (using terms meaningful to the user) to highlight interactions with software tools and resources in the service of achieving the scientific objective. Epics can also be thought of as big tasks, and should be written from the users perspective, e.g.: "build a dataset" or "analyze a dataset" or "turn raw sequence into called variants".*

## User Stories:
*Write 5-15 concise user stories that describe concrete interactions between the user and tools described above. In total these should deliver on all the epics and achieve all scientific objectives from the software perspective. The a USERSTORY is a single step task.*

*The text from a User Story is programatically transformed into a sentence, so the input, output and task *must* be written such that they complete the sentence:*

`Use <input> to <task> to generate <output>` as in:

```
input: list of candidate genes and several databases of expression data
output: expression data for candidate genes
task: search for candidate genes in database
```
