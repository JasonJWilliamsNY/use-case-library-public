# Use Case Library Glossary

The Use Case Library consists of a set of **user narratives**. Each
narrative captures one set of highly-related scientific objectives and
is achieved by a series of **user epics**. Each epic is enabled by a
set of **user stories**, which are technically-focused details about
how to achieve that epic.  User stories will often be shared among
different epics.

The Use Case Library also provides a set of high level **summaries** that
capture the essential scientific objectives and place them in the context
of larger goals and the Consortium timelines.

### Definitions

**Scientific objective:** a description of a scientific process, told
without reference to a specific technology solution. Focuses on
resources required, method(s) followed, and outcome(s) targeted. Can
be validated with scientific stakeholders (is this valuable as
written? Yes or no.)  *Note:* These are not currently represented
explicitly in the use case library.

**Persona:** a type of user who will appear in the epics and stories that follow.

**User epic:** a story, told from the user's perspective that captures a
valuable set of interactions with tools (e.g. software solutions) in
the service of achieving the scientific objective. Must be written in
terms that are meaningful to the user, preferably from their
perspective. Should include mentions of everything the user needs to
achieve their goal, even interactions that don't involve the software
or data we're designing. Can be validated with project leadership (Is
this valuable as written? Yes or no.) and verified with engineering
leadership (Did we deliver it in a way that fits this scenario? Yes or
no.)

**User story:** a specific piece of an epic that translates to a
well-scoped and defined piece of software or data engineering
work. Can be verified with engineering teams (Did we deliver it? Yes
or no.) Certain stories are likely to appear in multiple epics and
should not be duplicated if possible.

**User narrative:** a collection of related personas, objectives, epics and stories.
