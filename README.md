# Use Case Library

This GitHub repository contains the Markdown materials behind the NIH Data Commons Use Case Library, which is accessible at <http://nih-data-commons.us/use-case-library/>.

The Use Case Library provides a set of high-level summaries that capture the essential scientific objectives and place them in the context of larger goals and the Data Commons Pilot Phase Consortium timeline. The Use Case Library also consists of a set of user narratives that capture highly-related scientific objectives for biomedical research that can be achieved by a series of technically-focused user epics and stories. A detailed description of the structure the Use Case Library can be found in the [glossary](./templates/glossary.md).
