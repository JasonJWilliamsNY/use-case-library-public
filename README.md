## Getting started

Run:
```
snakemake

## Goals:

* free text markdown editing & display for descriptions
* formal metadata structure for linking between use case elements

## TODO:

* provide brief instructions for Team Copper people
* request specific help
* KC6
* get COPD in there/ask Team Carbon
* add an ordering option to the YAML header (lexicographic)

* add comments about where files are coming from
* link in idents in markdown descriptions
* add next, previous links.

## TODO medium term:
* create an "errors" output page
* add spell checker
* add internal link checker
* add use case glossary in.
* add author/contact info to YAML header

Questions:
