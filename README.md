## Getting started

```
cd library
../scripts/process.py *.md
cd ../output
mkdocs serve
```

## Goals:

* stable URL structure and permalinks
* free text markdown editing & display for descriptions
* formal metadata structure for linking between use case elements

## TODO:

* link in idents in markdown descriptions
* add next, previous?
* create an "errors" output
* add comments about where files are coming from
* add high level use case descriptions and links to specifics
* KC6
* get COPD in there/ask Team Carbon
* add an ordering option to the YAML header (lexicographic)

## TODO medium term:
* add spell checker
* add internal link checker
* add use case glossary in.
* add author/contact info to YAML header

Questions:
* how do we get an index page at the root?
* host this ...where? does readthedocs do versioning on mkdocs sites?
