This is a data processing problem that is deeply integrated with the research question at hand.  As above in point (2), the question would be, how do you harmonize HDL measurements for studies that measure HDL once vs studies that measure it across multiple visits?  How do you account for different measurement methods? Note that this is typically done in a way that is individual to each research project (so it cannot be done once, but in general must be done for each research project; any given harmonization may be reusable by some other projects, but will not generally be reusable).
