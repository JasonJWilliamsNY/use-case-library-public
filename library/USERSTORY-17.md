input: positon-based genomic annotations from multiple sources (e.g. GENCODE, GeneHancer)
output:  defined aggregation units based on genomic positions (e.g. genes, regulatory regions, etc.)
task: aggregate unit definitions (genomic position ranges)
tags:
- aggregation
- gencode
- genehancer
- genomic annotations
- genomic position
- multiple sources
