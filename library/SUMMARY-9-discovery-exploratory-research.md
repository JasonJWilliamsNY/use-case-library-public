**Scenario:**

I have my own raw genetic dataset that I’d like to explore
further. I’m not really sure what I’m looking for and want to explore
my data in conjunction with other data sets to find relevant genes
that are co-expressed or maybe tissues to look at. Phenotypic and
functional data would be good to explore in the future so I’d like to
save my initial exploration to build on in the future.

**Current approach:**

I can only do this on a small scale. It is a bit like hunt and peck.

**With Data Commons Phase 1:**

Standards for making datasets discoverable and interoperable
(including harmonization of metadata). Use of FAIR principles for
data. Cloud-based platform to analyze across genetic, phenotypic, and
functional data. Way to label query results so they can be retrieved
at a later date. Infrastructure to support exploratory research in a
cost and time effective manner.

**With Data Commons longer vision:**

My dataset can be used as a query against other datasets. Sharing raw
data in the Data Commons so it is accessible by other
researchers. Marketplace for finding datasets that others have
contributed to collaborate on. Policies around intellectual property
that encourage collaboration, open science, and protect researchers.
