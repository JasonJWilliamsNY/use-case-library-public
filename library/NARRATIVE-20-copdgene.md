### Scientific Objective

COPDGene is an NHLBI-funded study of more than 10,000 subjects designed to understand the risk factors, heterogeneity, and progression of COPD.  Whole genome sequencing of the entire cohort has been obtained in collaboration with TOPMed, and chest CT scans have been obtained on the entire COPDGene cohort.  Genetic variants and CT imaging data have been transferred to dbGaP, but only a fraction of the imaging data has been posted in dbGaP, and the format of the imaging data in dbGaP makes it challenging to use. The primary objective of this use case is to be able to integrate clinical, genomic and imaging data from the COPDGene study to enable GWAS and PheWAS research using Jupyter Notebook templates. As part of this research the user will be able to search and explore the data, review and annotate chest CT images, as well as analyze genomic and phenotypic research data.
