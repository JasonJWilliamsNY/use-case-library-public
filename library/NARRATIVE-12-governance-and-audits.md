### Scientific Objective

A Governance Authority (the Authority), is performing a security audit on a resource in the Data Commons. They access the Data Commons user interface for querying the audit trail, and obtain a machine readable statement of research purpose accompanying each (human-readable application for access to data), and an algorithm compares the data use restrictions to the researcherâ€™s purpose and lets them know whether the two are compatible and if manual review is required.
