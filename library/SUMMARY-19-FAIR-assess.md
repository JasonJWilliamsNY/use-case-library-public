Making digital research objects more findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) is critical for realizing the opportunity of accelerated progress in research through data science. To begin addressing this challenge, the FAIR guiding principles were established. However, software to systematically assess, store and display the FAIRness of biomedical digital objects is currently mostly not available. 

FAIRshake is a new software toolkit that was developed for the Data Commons to enable the assessment of compliance of biomedical digital research objects with the FAIR guiding principles. FAIRshake functions as a repository to store and serve FAIR assessments. It enable any user to start projects, contribute metrics and rubrics, and perform and display FAIR assessments.
