**Scenario:**

I am a teacher at a community college. I want a way for my students to
learn data science processes using real-life data. I do not have the
expertise or resources to do this on my own. I did this in graduate
school.

**Current approach:**

I can partner with a high performance computing center at a nearby
university. I can use a synthetic “experiment”.

**With Data Commons Phase 1:**

Public website that opens up access to data and tools. Leverage a
standard set of resources in the cloud. Support exploratory
investigation of data.

**With Data Commons longer vision:**

Training videos and workshops support continued learning. Community of
developers and users within the Data Commons support citizen
scientists.
