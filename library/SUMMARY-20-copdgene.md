**Scenario:**

Samuel wants to study Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs. He would like to search, explore, review and annotate chest CT images, as well as analyze genomic and phenotypic research data. Eventually, he'd like to integrate all of this data for use in a GWAS or PheWAS.

**Current approach:**

Genetic variants and CT imaging data are available in dbGaP, but only a fraction of the imaging data has been posted there. The format of the imaging data in dbGaP also makes it challenging to use.

**With Data Commons Phase 1:**

With his Data Commons ID, Samuel can log into COPDGene, a NHLBI-funded study of more than 10,000 subjects designed to understand the risk factors, heterogeneity, and progression of COPD. This database contains whole genome sequencing of the entire cohort has been obtained in collaboration with TOPMed, and chest CT scans have been obtained on the entire COPDGene cohort.
