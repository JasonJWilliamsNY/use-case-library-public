**Scenario:**

I have a patient with a new phenotype. I want to identify how common
this phenotype is; Iâ€™m looking for a molecular and genetic profile
associated with the phenotype. I want to know if there is a model
organism with the same phenotype so I can explore this functionally.

**Current approach:**

Right now, I would identify a genetic variant in my patient. I would
look through TOPMed to identify a cohort of individuals with a similar
phenotype. I would do a search to identify an associated gene then
look up the gene ID to identify associated data in GTEx. I would run a
different search in model organism data to look for something that
looks similar. This is not simple, is very messy, and time intensive.

**With Data Commons Phase 1:**

Access TOPMed, GTEx, and MODs data in one cloud workspace, conduct one
query to identify homologous data, analyze relevant human and mouse
data simultaneously using a pre-built infrastructure. Link phenotypic,
genotypic, gene and protein expression data for human and mouse
because it is already transformed/harmonized to identify novel
associations with the phenotype.

**With Data Commons longer vision:**

Published query and analysis in the Commons environment so this is
repeatable. Work with developers in the Data Commons community to set
up an automatic update of the study as more human data is added.
