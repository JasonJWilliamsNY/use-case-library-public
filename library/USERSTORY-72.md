input: An easy-to-use interface to explore clinical data to refine research questions and facilitate hypothesis development.
output: Provide a user-interface to explore clinical variables of interest to develop and refine hypothesis. The researcher will log-in the the COPDGene user interface. This interface to i2b2/tranSMART will allow the researcher to explore curated clinical data from the COPDGene study. The investigator can use the curated data to explore available variables and perform simple statistical analyses that return aggregate summary statistics.
task: User-interface to COPD clinical variables
