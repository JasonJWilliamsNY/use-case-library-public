**Scenario**

Brunhilda is interested in building a screening strategy that is tailored to the patients sex. To find sexual dimorphism for her phenotype, she wants to investigate phenotypic differences between males and females in large-scale screening program of a number of genetically modified model organisms.

**Current Approach**

Once Brunhilda had the list of organisms she would like to test, she would have to spend a great deal of time constructing a large dataset. Knock-out libraries for her organims (mouse, rat, zebrafish, xenopus, drosophila, C. elegans, and yeast) will all need to be seperated by sex, and have ontology terms mapped onto the genes so Burnhilda can eventually look for differential expression between sexes for homologous genes. This process will require not only a great deal of time, but a huge amount of domain specific knowledge. From a technology standpoint, libraries from different organisims are usually be stored in different, non-compatible, formats. From a biological standpoint, genetic events like gene and genome duplication events and gene losses will result in non-one-to-one mappings between species.
