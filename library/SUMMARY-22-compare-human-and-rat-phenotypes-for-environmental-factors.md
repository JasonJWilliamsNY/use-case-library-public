**Scenario:**

Nancy wants to compare the effect of environmental factors such as diet and activity, genotype and phenotype profiles between particular rat strains and human cohorts exhibiting similar genotype and phenotype profiles to identify the impact of environmental factors on phenotype expression from particular genotypes and to identify particular rat strains that might mimic human cohorts for preclinical studies. In addition, she would like to examine the impacts of age and sex.

**Current approach:**

Nancy would have to utilize a lot of time and effort to accomplish this task.
