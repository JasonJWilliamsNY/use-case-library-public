Identify a credible set of causal variants at each genome-wide significant locus. 
For each variant in each of the credible sets, utilize the GTEx dataset to perform an eQTL analysis that associates each variant within each of the credible sets with the expression of nearby genes.
Leverage ENCODE datasets to look at potential annotations associated with non-coding variants in the credible sets.
