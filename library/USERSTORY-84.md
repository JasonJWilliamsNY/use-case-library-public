input: Results from automatically generated Jupyter Notebook and the researcher's observation and interpretation of results
output: Identified differentially expressed genes and gene sets and small molecules predicted to reverse expression across all tissues
task: Use the automatically generated Jupyter Notebook to observe and share results including common differentially expressed genes and gene sets that are unique for each tissue and identify common small molecules that are predicted to reverse expression across all tissues
