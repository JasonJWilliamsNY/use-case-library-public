### Scientific Objective

Although most users will rely on derived data produced by the data stewards, some advanced users will want to use raw data. Raw data can be used for many downstream applications such as methods development or validation, reanalysis using different methods, Discovery/validation of rare genes or transcripts by pooling all available RNA-seq samples, and joint variant calling.
