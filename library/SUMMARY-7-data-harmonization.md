title: Data Harmonization

**Scenario:**

I am trying to connect phenotypic variables from one study to
another. They are currently labeled differently and categorized in a
different data format even though the variables mean the same thing.

**Current approach:**

Right now, time consuming process of trying to manually, and
potentially using computer algorithms, match variable names across
different studies. Spend lots of time and money cleaning up data.

**With Data Commons Phase 1:**

A common metadata model eases the burden of data harmonization.

**With Data Commons longer vision:**

A set of harmonization approaches are
made available to all stacks through a network effect. This set is the
result of Data Commons users sharing previously harmonized data. Users
collectively validate harmonization to increase trust in the metadata
model. Computer scientists develop deep learning techniques to suggest
improvements to harmonization that are verified by the user community.
